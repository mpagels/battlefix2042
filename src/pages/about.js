        ðŸ’“ I love playing Battlefield! <br /> I want that the game to succeed,
        because like a lot of other people despite the current state of the
        game, I think it has a lot of potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        I made the app for everybody who wants to keep track of the current
        state of the game and give the possibility to keep track of things that
        are important for each gamer personally. Let's face it: Not everyone is
        sad about the fact that they are no single player campaign. ;-){" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        With this app you can select the features you really want in the game
        and I will update the list on every patch note. So you can relax and
        check the app once in a while.
      </p>

      <p>Have fun, see you on the battlefield.</p>

      <p>Martin</p>

        If you want to get in touch with me or have a feature idea for the app,
        write me an email or a pm on Reddit.
